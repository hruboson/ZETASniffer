## External libraries

- **args** - A single-header C++ library used for parsing of command line arguments. The library is the `args.hxx` file. Source: [Github repository](https://github.com/Taywee/args).

## Tests
All testing was done comparing the output of Wireshark with my sniffer. Below are some examples of comparison between Wireshark and my implementation.
